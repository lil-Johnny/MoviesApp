🎬 Movie Discovery Web App

A responsive movie discovery application built with React that allows users to explore popular movies, view detailed information, and search for films in real time. The app consumes a public movie API to dynamically fetch and display up-to-date movie data with a clean and intuitive user interface.

This project was developed to strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals, API integration, and modern front-end development practices.
